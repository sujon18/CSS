        <p>A dragon is a large magical legendary creature that appears in the folklore of multiple cultures
            worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in Western cultures since
            the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in
            eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average
            intelligence. Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, reptilian,

            modern Asian dragon imagery.
